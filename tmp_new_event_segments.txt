4. Escape room :- 
Hum dono ek dojo mein phans jaye aur talwar ka ek hi raasta bache? Take that to the 
next level with our Samurai Escape Room! .Battle against time as you and your 
clan attempt to break free from the enemy fortress. Navigate through ancient scrolls, 
hidden traps, cryptic symbols, and riddles forged in the way of the Samurai. 
Sharpen your mind. Honor your clan. Escape… before the final gong strikes! 
Rulebook:- 
1. Teams of 3–4 warriors will be locked inside a guarded Shogun fortress. 
2. Hidden within the fortress are ancient scrolls, symbols, and challenges that 
will help you regain freedom before the final gong. 
3. No prior knowledge of martial arts or history is required — every clue needed 
to escape lies within the fortress walls. 
4. No food or snacks shall be carried inside — a true Samurai remains disciplined. 
5. No forceful destruction of props, scrolls, or fortress items. 
 Damaging the sacred artifacts leads to instant dishonor and disqualification. 
6. You will have 25 minutes to break free. 
 Your escape time will be recorded and added to the Warrior Leaderboard. 
7. You may seek up to 3 divine hints from the Grand Game Master. 
 But beware — 4 minutes will be added to your final time for each hint used. 
 Choose with the wisdom of a Samurai. 
8. None of the trials require raw strength or brute force. 
 If a piece does not move easily, it is not the Samurai way. 
9. Any locks you encounter will require the secret combination or key hidden 
within the fortress — do not attempt to break them. 
10. Once you escape, guard the secrets of the fortress. 
 Do not reveal puzzles or solutions to fellow warriors who have yet to face the 
challenge.
